<p>This vignette introduces spatial conservation prioritization, a
powerful approach for deciding <strong>where</strong> conservation
actions matter most.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="the-geography-of-conservation-decisions">The Geography of Conservation Decisions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-geography-of-conservation-decisions"></a>
</h2>
<p>Spatial conservation decisions are ultimately decisions about
<strong>where to act.</strong> Even when conservation goals are global,
the real impact happens in specific places, whether it’s a forest, a
coral reef, a river basin, or a broader landscape. Because space is
finite, conservation always involves <strong>making
choices</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protecting one area usually means not protecting another, at least
not immediately or to the same extent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simple yet crucial reality shapes modern conservation
planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Biodiversity is unevenly distributed</strong> across the
globe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Threats vary spatially</strong>, affecting some areas more
than others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resources are limited</strong>, creating competition among
different land uses and priorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, conservation operates under constraints such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited budgets,</li>
<li>Conflicting land uses,</li>
<li>Multiple objectives that cannot all be maximized
simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints are <strong>not failures</strong>, they are the
<strong>starting point</strong> for effective, strategic conservation
planning.</p>

<h2 id="from-spatial-patterns-to-decision-challenges">From Spatial Patterns to Decision Challenges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-spatial-patterns-to-decision-challenges"></a>
</h2>
<p>Over the past decades, conservation science has made enormous
progress in data availability. Species distribution models, habitat
maps, remote sensing products, and global biodiversity databases are now
more accessible than ever. However, conservation planners are often
challenged not by a lack of data, but by the <strong>difficulty of
turning complex, sometimes incomplete data into clear
decisions</strong>.</p>
<p>A common first approach is to layer maps on top of one another:
visualizing species richness, threat levels, or habitat extent. While
informative, this rarely leads to clear choices.</p>
<p>When multiple features are considered simultaneously,
<strong>conflicts emerge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Areas important for one species may be less important for
another.</li>
<li>Regions with high biodiversity value may overlap with areas of
intense human use.</li>
</ul>
<p>This often leads to a familiar frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have all the information I need — so why is deciding still so
hard?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem lies not in the data alone, but in the <strong>lack of a
structured way to resolve trade-offs across space</strong>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Many conservation decisions are often seen as simple <strong>binary
choices</strong>: protect or not protect, include or exclude. But in
reality, conservation planning rarely works this way. Decisions are
usually <strong>incremental</strong> — actions happen over time, budgets
change, and priorities evolve as new information becomes available. In
this dynamic context, <strong>flexibility is key</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of asking <em>“Should this area be protected?”</em> planners
often need to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which areas matter more?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which actions should happen first?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If only part of a landscape can be addressed now, where
should we start?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This shift from <strong>selection</strong> to
<strong>prioritization</strong> fundamentally changes the problem.The
goal is no longer to find a single “best” solution, but to support
<strong>informed decisions</strong> that work under uncertainty and
constraints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding this shift helps planners make smarter choices that
adapt to real-world challenges.</p>

</h2>
<p>Many conservation decisions are framed as binary choices: protect or
do not protect, include or exclude. In reality, conservation planning
rarely works this way. Decisions are typically incremental. Actions are
taken over time, budgets change, and priorities are revised as new
information becomes available. In this context, flexibility matters.
Rather than asking whether an area should be protected at all, planners
often need to ask which areas matter more, and which actions should
happen first. If only part of a landscape can be addressed in the short
term, which locations should receive priority? This shift—from selection
to prioritization—changes the nature of the problem. The goal is no
longer to define a single optimal solution, but to support informed
choices under uncertainty and constraint.</p>

<h2 id="ordering-space-by-importance">Ordering space by importance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ordering-space-by-importance"></a>
</h2>
<p>Spatial conservation prioritization addresses this challenge by
ordering locations according to their relative importance for
biodiversity conservation. Instead of dividing space into protected and
unprotected areas, it produces a ranking that reflects how much each
location contributes to overall conservation goals. This ordering is
inherently comparative. The importance of a given place depends on how
it complements other places, how many features it supports, and how
irreplaceable it is within the broader landscape. A ranked solution
allows decision-makers to explore different levels of conservation
action, adjust boundaries, and evaluate trade-offs transparently. At
this stage, no algorithms or technical details are required to
understand the idea. What matters is the conceptual shift: conservation
planning becomes a process of ordering space by importance, rather than
drawing fixed lines on a map.</p>

<h2 id="zonation-as-a-practical-implementation">Zonation as a practical implementation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zonation-as-a-practical-implementation"></a>
</h2>
<p>With the problem fully built, Zonation is introduced naturally.
Explain that: • Zonation produces a spatial ranking of conservation
importance • It integrates multiple biodiversity features • It supports
transparent and reproducible decision-making At this point, curiosity
about how is earned — not forced.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="how-this-package-fits-in">How this package fits in<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-this-package-fits-in"></a>
</h2>
<p>This section grounds expectations. Clarify that ZonationR: • does not
replace Zonation • helps structure and run analyses from R • is designed
for learning, teaching, and reproducible workflows This sets up the
transition to practical work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="installing-zonation">Installing Zonation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-zonation"></a>

<p>Zonation is external software. Cover: • What installation means in
practice • Platform differences (Windows vs Linux) • Why installation is
separate from this package No commands yet — just orientation.</p>
