\title{Plot summary performance curves from Zonation output}
\usage{
summary_curves(
  data_path,
  metrics,
  facet = FALSE,
  save_path = NULL,
  dpi = 300,
  width = 8,
  height = 6
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_path}{Character. Path to the Zonation output file
(\code{summary_curves.csv}).}

\item{metrics}{Character vector. Names of the summary metrics to plot.
Metrics can be overlaid only if they share the same units and value range.
Fraction-based metrics can be overlaid together, while
\code{remaining_area} and \code{remaining_cost} cannot be overlaid with
other metrics.}

\item{facet}{Logical. If TRUE, metrics are plotted in separate panels. This
should be used when plotting metrics with different units or value ranges.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{save_path}{Character. Optional file path to save the plot. The file
format is inferred from the file extension (e.g. ".tiff").}

\item{dpi}{Numeric. Resolution (dots per inch) for saved figures. Default is
300.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Width of the saved figure in inches. Default is 8.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Height of the saved figure in inches. Default is 6.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object visualizing one or more Zonation summary
metrics plotted against priority rank.
}
\description{
This function reads a Zonation summary curves file and plots one or more
summary metrics against the priority rank. The output is a ggplot object,
which can be further customized by the user. Optionally, the plot can be
saved to disk as a high-quality figure.
